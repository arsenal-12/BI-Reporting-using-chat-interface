Example 10:Plot a line chart showing the total sales amount per month for the year 2016..

SQL command:`SELECT strftime('%m', Orders.OrderDate) AS Month,SUM([OrderDetails].UnitPrice * [OrderDetails].Quantity * (1 - [OrderDetails].Discount)) AS TotalSales FROM [OrderDetails] INNER JOIN Orders ON [OrderDetails].OrderID = Orders.OrderID INNER JOIN Products ON [OrderDetails].ProductID = Products.ProductID WHERE strftime('%Y', Orders.OrderDate) = '2016' GROUP BY Month;`

Example 11:Create a bar chart displaying the number of orders shipped by each shipper..

SQL command:`SELECT ShipperID, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfOrders FROM Shippers GROUP BY ShipperID;`

Example 12:Generate a pie chart showing the distribution of products by category..

SQL command:`SELECT CategoryName, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfProducts FROM Products JOIN Categories ON Products.CategoryID = Categories.CategoryID GROUP BY CategoryName;`

Example 13:Create a histogram showing the distribution of unit prices for products

SQL command:`SELECT UnitPrice FROM Products;`

Example 14:Plot a scatter plot showing the relationship between order quantity and unit price.

SQL command:`SELECT Quantity AS OrderQuantity, UnitPrice FROM [OrderDetails] GROUP BY Quantity, UnitPrice ORDER BY Quantity, UnitPrice;`

Example 15:Generate an area chart representing the total sales amount per year.

SQL command:`SELECT YEAR(OrderDate) AS Year,SUM(UnitPrice * Quantity * (1 - Discount)) AS TotalSales FROM Orders JOIN [OrderDetails] ON Orders.OrderID = [OrderDetails].OrderID GROUP BY YEAR(OrderDate) ORDER BY YEAR(OrderDate);`
